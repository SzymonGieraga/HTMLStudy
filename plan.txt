Room Makeover
1. Clearance & Preparation
The process begins with removing all unnecessary items.
All portable furniture and their contents will be relocated to the garage to maximize workspace and ease movement around the room.
As the bed is too time-consuming to dismantle or move, it will remain in the room, covered with protective foil to shield it from dust and paint splatters.
2. Painting
The current beige tone will be eliminated to freshen up the space. Three walls are to be painted in an urban gray.
The fourth wall, specifically the one behind the desk, will be finished in a emerald green.
This accent wall is designed not only to be in line with the newest trends but also to help relieve eye strain from computer use.
3. Refurnishing
The final phase involves a complete furniture replacement. The old setup will be removed.
In its place, I will assemble and install new cabinets and a spacious desk with height-adjustable feature, all in a sophisticated black oak finish to contrast with the new wall colors.
The only old furniture remaining will be the wardrobe. It’s in good condition and the counter part available in the newer set wasn’t as spacious as the current one.
